# Courier Route Optimization Service

## Problem Description

### Current Situation
A growing e-commerce company faces significant challenges in managing daily delivery operations. With multiple couriers serving different urban areas, the manual process of planning delivery routes leads to:

- **Inefficient routes** causing fuel waste and time loss
- **Unbalanced workload** between couriers
- **Missed delivery deadlines** and customer dissatisfaction
- **Lack of real-time route optimization** based on actual order addresses

### Business Context
The company operates from a central warehouse that serves as the distribution hub. Each courier is assigned to a specific work area within the city where they have geographical knowledge and established delivery patterns. The current manual dispatch system cannot efficiently handle the increasing order volume while maintaining delivery quality standards.
